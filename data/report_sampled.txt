There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral\n nodular opacities that most likely represent nipple shadows. The\n cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Clips project over the left lung,\n potentially within the breast. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.\n Chronic deformity of the posterior left sixth and seventh ribs are noted.
Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar\n contours are unremarkable.  New nodular opacities are clustered within the\n left upper lobe, and to a lesser extent, within the right upper lobe.  There\n is no pneumothorax or left-sided pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is\n within normal limits.  Postsurgical changes are noted in the right chest with\n partial resection of the right 6th rib, lateral right pleural thickening and\n chronic blunting of the costophrenic sulcus.
Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and\n diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. \n Previous pattern of mild pulmonary edema has essentially resolved.  Mild\n atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation.  Blunting\n of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggests trace bilateral pleural\n effusions, not substantially changed in the interval.  No pneumothorax is\n present.
Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable,\n with atherosclerotic calcifications noted throughout the thoracic aorta.  The\n pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or\n pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There is diffuse demineralization of the\n osseous structures with apparent ossification of the anterior longitudinal\n ligament.
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall\n change.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular\n congestion and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar\n atelectasis.  Right Pleurx catheter is again seen without evidence of\n pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with substantial\n volume loss in the left lower lobe, though superimposed pneumonia would have\n to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
Cardiac silhouette size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous. \n Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  No focal\n consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no\n acute osseous abnormalities.
PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires are\n again noted.  Pulmonary edema persists without significant overall change.  No\n large effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing evidence for pneumonia though\n subtle pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.  The cardiomediastinal\n silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the\n right hemidiaphragm.
There is no evidence of a large hiatal hernia on the lateral radiograph.  The\n inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are clear without focal\n consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is\n not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and\n hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.
The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.\n The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  Linear opacity overlying the lower\n thoracic vertebral bodies on lateral view is most compatible with atelectasis,\n but pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are\n clear without calcifications or cavitary lesions.  There is no pleural\n effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized bones appear unremarkable.
In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube remains\n in place, approximately 2.4 cm above the carina.  Slightly improved\n inspiration with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Retrocardiac\n atelectatic change persists with blunting of the costophrenic angle on this\n side.
Linear densities are suggestive of atelectasis or scarring.  There is no\n definite parenchymal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion.  The aorta\n is ectatic.  No definite evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. \n Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is again seen.  Lower lung volumes are\n noted.  There are persistent bibasilar opacities now more conspicuous the left\n when compared to the right which could represent pneumonia.  Superior lungs\n are clear consolidation but notable for pulmonary vascular congestion.
Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous radiograph.  A left-sided\n AICD/ pacemaker device is again noted with leads in unchanged positions.  Mild\n cardiomegaly with a left ventricular predominance is again seen.  The\n mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not\n engorged.  Linear and patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of\n atelectasis.
Over 24 hours, there has been interval improvement in hazy right\n lower lobe opacity, which likely reflects improvement in atelectasis.  There\n is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiac\n silhouette is normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal.
PA and lateral radiographs of the chest depict clear lungs and\n normal hilar and mediastinal contours.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural\n effusion and the pulmonary vascularity appears normal without evidence of\n interstitial edema.
The cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable.  The\n mediastinal contours are similar to the most recent examination, and largely\n unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are\n clear aside from basilar atelectasis.
AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided. Midline sternotomy wires\n and mediastinal clips are again noted.  Right upper extremity PICC line is\n again seen with its tip in the expected location of the low SVC. Lung volumes\n are low with mild left basilar platelike atelectasis.
Left lingular consolidations, which on recent torso CT demonstrated\n to have a central low-density area and concerning for an abscess is unchanged\n since prior radiograph dated ___.  Mild-to-moderate left pleural\n effusion has increased.
Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. \n Port-A-Cath tip projects over right atrium.  Moderate bilateral pleural\n effusions are present.  Bibasilar opacities are noted.  No pneumothorax. \n Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  No\n pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
AP portable upright view of the chest.   The lungs are hyperinflated and\n clear.  Overlying EKG leads are present.  There is no focal consolidation,\n effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
PA and lateral views of the chest provided.\n \n Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis again noted.  No large\n effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable and\n within normal limits.
Status post removal of a left chest\n tube, without evidence of a pneumothorax.  A small left pleural effusion and\n left basilar atelectasis have improved.  There is stable postoperative\n widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Multiple median sternotomy\n wires and mediastinal clips relate to the recent surgery.
